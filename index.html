 <p class="sectiontag text-small">The electric vehicle industry in India is slowly growing. The central and state governments have implemented schemes and incentives to promote electric mobility, and have introduced regulations and standards. Although India would benefit from converting its transport from internal combustion (IC) engines to electric motors, challenges include a lack of charging infrastructure, high initial cost and a lack of renewable energy. E-commerce companies, car manufacturers, app-based transport network companies and mobility-solution providers have entered the sector, however, and are slowly building electric-car capacity and visibility</p>

 <p class="sectiontag text-big"> National Electric Mobility Mission Plan.</p>

 <p class="sectiontag text-small">Electric vehicles are three to five times more efficient than internal-combustion vehicles in utilising energy. If electric vehicles run on electricity produced from fossil fuels, their overall efficiency remains higher and their pollution is less; large thermal power plants are more efficient than IC engines, and it is easier to control emissions from power plants than from vehicle engines. Electric vehicles save energy by regenerative braking. Thirty to seventy percent of the energy used for propulsion can be recovered, with higher percentages in stop-and-go city driving.</p></div>

 <p class="sectiontag text-small">The Indian government has defined public charging stations and EV charging businesses as de-licensed activity.[12][13] It has been specified that each 3-by-3-kilometre (1.9 by 1.9 mi) area in cities must have at least one charging station, and one station every 25 kilometres (16 mi) on both sides of highways. These guidelines were mandated in cities with populations of over four million and all expressways and major highways connecting those cities by 2022. The second phase (three to five years) will focus on large cities, such as state capitals and Union Territory headquarters.[14] Plugin India is an initiative to facilitate community charging stations,.</p>
